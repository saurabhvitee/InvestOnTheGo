# Cash By Chance

Cash By Chance is a combination of a wallet/upi app with automatic smart investment integration. It would make the entire investment process completely painless. 

## How would this work?

An average user makes somewhere from 50-100+ transactions a month on UPI/wallets
Most of these transactions are odd amounts which are not whole. Ex : Rs.11, Rs.23, Rs.42
We can round off these transactions to the nearest whole number say Rs.20 Rs.30 or Rs.50 and invest the difference automatically into funds and other instruments based on the user’s risk profile

At the end of the month, we can highlight the returns form the auto investments as “rewards”.
When onboarding a user, we would ask a basic questionnaire that will help us establish the investor profile including their risk appetite and performance expectations
We would automatically find potential investment opportunities for them, pool funds together and invest automatically
The project would combine Gpay/Paytm style ease of payments with the benefit of automated portfolio management attached to it.

Refer to the Readme of the following four folders to get better understanding of working of the project-:
1. pyetf  :  Module which uses etfdb.com to fetch market data.
2. backend : A fastapi based rest backend.
3. frontend : A react frontend.
4. backend/rebalancing : The trade optimizer and rebalancing workflow.
